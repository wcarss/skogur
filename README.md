A world to explore.

Initial base (hand typed!) from watching Sebastian Lague's [Landmass Generation Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0eBW2EiBtl_sxmDtSgZBxB3) series, with a few small tweaks and differences. Initial commit corresponds roughly to episode 10 of that series, "E10: seams", at which point the generation creates a perlin noise map and builds a coloured mesh based on it, using a multi-threaded chunk generation system.

I'll hopefully continue through that series and then start taking it further into my own directions.
